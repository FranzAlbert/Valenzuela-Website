<section><h2>Preschool</h2><p>I was a very lively kid back in Pre-school, would always be around of people, playing, and chatting with them, pre-school was very nostalgic for me, but from then it came with a past i would only want to forget, i had an accident making my thinking very slow, i dont let it define me but it has only made me proccess slower than ever. Although i had a decent performance in my academics, pre-school was nostalgic but it came with some regrets.  </p></section>

<section><h2>Elementary</h2><p>I was a very immature or mature boy, in the middle i guess, i had a lot of unforgetable memories, and quite all of them were bad ones, other than that elementary was quite weird to the many stubborn kids and classmates, though i did get to expirience dating, but it was a horrible first experience, elementary thought me a lot and i like it, i managed to use it in junior high which was big help. </p></section>

<section><h2>High School</h2><p>High School, i love this experience, i went through so much fun and learning, made some friends and gave me the best time of my life, i academically perform decent. I like being media due to photography, i have manage to get people to know me and like my photos, WVRAA was a great example as i got to learn more about life and photography, needless to say HighSchool was one of the best experiences i had.</p></section>
